{"name":"Scrollhappen","tagline":"A jquery plugin which load elements while there is no scroll bar on the page and also load elements when scroll bar touch to the botttom.","body":"### Introduction\r\nscrollHappen jQuery plugin basically meant for the developers who want to load content while scroll bar touch to bottom and fill the canvas while there is no scroll bar in the page. It has several limitation and also have lots of advantages. As I have provided a button (Load Rest)at the end of the scroll Cycle which enable the user to load the rest of the element on clicking that button. As Other plug-ins provide infinite scrolling feature I do so because it's important for one who don't want any kind of limitation on scrolling and loading the elements on scroll touch to the bottom.\r\n\r\n### Environments on which it's been Tested\r\nThis plug-in is been tested on all browser (Mozilla, Chrome, IE > 8, Safari) and it works perfectly in all browser's and also on each zoom level of each browser.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with scrollHappen plug-in?

It has several limitation and also have lots of advantages. As I have provided a button (Load Rest)at the end of the scroll Cycle which enable the user to load the rest of the element on clicking that button. As Other plug-ins provide infinite scrolling feature I do so because it's important for one who don't want any kind of limitation on scrolling and loading the elements on scroll touch to the bottom.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nThis plug-in is been tested on all browser (Mozilla, Chrome, IE > 8, Safari) and it works perfectly in all browser's and also on each zoom level of each browser.\r\n\r\n### Plugin defaults(optional)\r\nThese defaults are already mentioned within plug-in so if you won't mention it while defining it on your page then it would behave default.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndefaults: {\r\n            infiniteScroll: false, \r\n            initialLimit: 4,\r\n            limit: 4,\r\n            cycle: 3,\r\n            ajaxSettings: {\r\n                async: false,\r\n                global: false,\r\n                type: 'GET',\r\n                dataType: 'script'\r\n            },\r\n            loadingHtmlAttrs: {\r\n                content: '<small>loading...</small>',\r\n                class: 'loading'\r\n            },\r\n            loadRestCallbackAttrs: {\r\n                content: '<button>Load Rest</button>',\r\n                class: 'load_rest'\r\n            },\r\n            loadRestCallback: function () {\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n```\r\n>Required options\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n   **url**: 'url to hit for next set of element',\r\n   **total_elements**: 'you need to define the total no. of elements you want to iterate on',\r\n}\r\n```\r\nAs you know you can change the defaults as per your requirement.\r\n\r\n###Description of each option \r\n### How To\r\nTo use scrollHappen Plug-in you need to download it first and include it in your application.\r\n**Apply this plug-in on a class or id where it contains loading element means apply it on the parent div of loading element.**\r\nfor e.g.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div class=\"parent\">\r\n  <div class=\"child\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"child\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"child\">\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div class=\"child\">\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\nNow apply it on the parent div with some must required options of plug-in: \r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$('.parent').scrollHappen(function(){\r\n     url: 'url to hit for next set of element',\r\n     total_elements: 'you need to define the total no. of elements you want to iterate on',\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile.
